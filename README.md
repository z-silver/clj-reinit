# clj-reinit

`clj-reinit` is to [clj-reload](https://github.com/tonsky/clj-reload)/[init](https://github.com/ferdinand-beyer/init) as [integrant-repl](https://github.com/weavejester/integrant-repl) is to [tools.namespace](https://github.com/clojure/tools.namespace)/[integrant](https://github.com/weavejester/integrant).

Except it's way cooler.

## Dependency

```
io.github.z-silver/clj-reinit {:git/tag "0.1.0" :git/sha "e90477d"}
```

There is no jar release at the moment. Apologies for the inconvenience.

## Why?

Because unlike the tools based on `tools.namespace`, `clj-reinit` offers not only reloading on demand but also reloading automatically. That is: it is capable of reloading your code as soon as you save it, without the need to explicitly ask for a reload. If you've used [figwheel](https://figwheel.org/) or [shadow-cljs](https://github.com/thheller/shadow-cljs), you should be familiar with this workflow.

## No, seriously, why?

Because I've recently discovered `init` and find it nicer to use than `integrant`.

I was slightly bummed out that there was no equivalent to `integrant-repl` for `init`. But since I had also recently learned about `clj-reload`, which I prefer over `tools.namespace`, I figured: why not?

Since I'm very used to the instant feedback cycle you typically get with Clojurescript, I decided to also attempt to do something similar for JVM Clojure, which is not something I've seen before.

## How?

We exploit the fact that `clj-reload` expects you to tell it which directories your source code is located, and use it to spin up a watcher that detects whenever a file in those directories has changed. We also exploit the fact that we're using `init` and piggyback on it to manage the lifetime of said watcher.

Similar to `integrant-repl`, we expect the user to choose a var containing a configuration function. This is because we otherwise have no way of knowing what system you want to run.

I recommend reading the source code comments for all the details, as well as `dev/user.clj` for a tiny example of how you may set up your own project's dev environment.

## Caveats

If compilation fails during a reload, you'll have to manually run `reset` after you fix your code. This is because reloading stops the system, which also stops the watcher component. You'll also need to call `clear-error`, because we use an agent to hold the system state.

If you need to run commands in the REPL after having an auto-reload, you'll still need to run `reset` to make the new version of the code available in the REPL. For this reason, auto-reloading is actually off by default and needs to be explicitly enabled.

## Acknowledgements

* `clj-reload` and `init`, the foundations which we compose together.
* [dirwatch](https://github.com/juxt/dirwatch), for implementing a very nice, no-nonsense interface over Java's WatchService.
* `integrant-repl`, the direct inspiration for this lib.
* You, for taking the time to read and perhaps use this.
